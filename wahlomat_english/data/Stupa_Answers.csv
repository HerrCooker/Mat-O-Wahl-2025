1;"The student contribution should only be increased in a reasonable and limited way if it secures specific services that benefit students — such as NextBike, bike transport with the semester ticket, or funding for services offered by the (autonomous) AStA and student councils."
-1;""
-1;"Taking a stance in these times would actually be appropriate and meaningful. However, the StuPa already includes many different opinions and political positions, making it unlikely to agree on a unified stance. This would likely make decisions on funding political projects significantly harder.
Additionally, there is a noticeable shift to the right in society — and in the StuPa"
0;"Sadly, respect and consideration for others cannot be enforced by obligation."
1;"Yes — and also in small quantities in the men's restrooms."
1;"Yes, because there are still instances of inappropriate behavior or situations where individuals feel unsafe or uncomfortable at events. There needs to be a well-thought-out and enforceable awareness concept for these cases."
-1;"If someone submits a proper excuse, there should be no sanctions. Ideally, the person should authorize a substitute to attend in their place if possible."
1;"Helps students with exam anxiety. Certainly won’t harm anyone’s mental health."
1;"Yes — as long as it's available, it should be used, especially if it isn't significantly more expensive than the NRW semester ticket."
1;"Why not?"
1;"Why not?"
-1;"For obvious reasons, we reject research for military purposes."
-1;"a) That goes against our own list. b) This kind of structure completely excludes non-binary people. c) Quotas should reflect willingness and capacity to participate — not gender."
-1;"No — but sessions should be kept as short as possible. Once a pre-agreed time is reached, the current agenda item should be concluded, and the remaining items postponed."
1;"Yes — more visibility and transparency is always helpful."
-1;"No — but if there's a clear demand from the student body, then new departments should be considered."
1;"Autonomous departments are, first and foremost, autonomous. Unlike the core AStA, they currently have no voting rights in StuPa. This means they’re at a clear disadvantage — not only are they unable to vote on matters concerning them, they often aren’t even consulted."

-1;"Unfortunately, the question is conceptually unclear. At UDE there is no student contribution, but a social and student body contribution, which is made up of a mobility contribution, a social contribution for the student union and the student body contribution. This total contribution should not be increased, as studying should not be a luxury, but should be accessible to everyone. A higher social and student body contribution would place an even greater burden on students with financial difficulties."

A higher social and student body contribution would place an even greater burden on students with financial difficulties."
1;"Our university is not an apolitical space. For a better society, we need a student body that is committed and clearly opposes right-wing structures, discrimination, social injustice and the capitalist system."
0;"We support gender-appropriate languages and are in favor of the inclusion of all people. Nevertheless, we are not in favor of mandatory regulations. We want to create real awareness for inclusive language and not work with sanctions."
1;"Menstrual products should not be a luxury. The university should therefore provide free menstrual products. However, as long as the university is not aware of its duty to provide funding for these products, the student body must show solidarity."
1;"Awareness concepts are necessary so that everyone can feel comfortable and a safe environment can be created that is free from violence and discrimination. That is why we are in favor of a mandatory awareness concept that offers contact persons, protects all people from abusive behavior and represents an important step towards equal and respectful coexistence."
-1;"Membership of the Student Parliament is an honorary position. Sanctioning proper behavior contradicts the idea of such an honorary position. It is also not clear in the question what is meant by ""frequently"", nor what any sanctions would look like. The only thing that comes to mind here is the loss of office. However, there are understandable reasons why members of parliament may have to stay away from a meeting. This must not lead to a loss of office. Parliamentarians are also democratically elected and should not simply be allowed to lose their position"
1;"Limiting the number of possible examination attempts leads to unnecessary examination pressure and is not in the interests of the students. Removing the limit contributes to an improvement in equal opportunities, reduces the pressure to perform and thus reduces the physical and psychological strain on students."
1;"The Deutschlandticket provides students with affordable and sustainable mobility and must therefore be secured. In the long term, we are committed to free, nationwide public transport."
1;"Outdoor recreation areas create places to relax and get together, which is why we are committed to creating many such recreation areas where the student body can relax and socialize. The university must not be a place where there is only pressure to perform and competition."
1;"Different realities of life must be taken into account by extending opening hours. However, this must not be at the expense of employees."
-1;"Science and research should be free and not in the hands of the market and should therefore not be used for military purposes. Rather, it is the task of science and research to create better living conditions for all people and to enable everyone to live together in peace."
0;"The obligation of equal representation does not necessarily mean that all genders are equally represented in the stupa. Rather, there is a risk that people will be excluded simply because they cannot find like-minded people of the other gender. We as the Left List, for example, would not be able to stand for election as our list only consists of women."
-1;"A time limit would restrict the democratic process, as the content-related discussions in the Stupa would no longer be conducted in line with their content, but only in line with the timetable. There would be a risk that individual members would limit their own participation for fear of not being able to adhere to the specified time frame. For this reason, we reject a time limit for Stupa meetings."
1;"Many students know nothing about the social services offered by AstA and the autonomous departments. For this reason, the StuPa should do more public relations work to educate students and enable them to represent their interests in a self-determined way."
0;"We are generally open to expanding the number of autonomous units, but this should be decided according to need. We do not currently see this need due to the existing units."
-1;"Unfortunately, the question is not clear to us. The framework conditions of the autonomous departments are defined in §17 of the student body statutes. Who should determine the framework conditions in addition to or instead of the StuPa and in what form?"
0;"At the moment, we do not have an overview of the amount of income and expenditure of the student councils. We will be very happy to look into this issue after our election."

0;"We advocate the sensitive use of language and gender is part of everyday life for us. However, we do not want to police language like conservatives who advocate bans or obligations. There are many different ways to speak/write inclusively and we want to promote and raise awareness of these different ways."
1;"Free menstruation products in public places should be a matter of course. As long as the university does not comply with this, others should provide them."
1;"An awareness concept is a necessary part of events where many different people come together. It should be the task of the StuPa to provide a mandatory template for this."
-1;"Students can withdraw for many individual reasons. We stand for a culture of discussion within the university groups instead of sanctions."
1;"A fixed number of examination attempts is part of the pressure to perform at university. We firmly oppose this."
1;"The Deutschlandticket enables flexible travel, for example to family who in some cases live outside NRW. Of course, we are committed to ensuring that this is offered as cheaply as possible."
1;"More greenery on campus contributes to a better learning atmosphere,"
1;"In particular, the opportunity to eat in the main canteens in the evening after a lecture is very important to us."
-1;"As an anti-militarist student association, we strongly oppose any weakening of the civil clause. The Bundeswehr and military research have no place at university. For us, the university is a place of understanding and peace research."
1;"We advocate a quota system for the lists, which provides for at least 50% FINTA* representation (women, intersex, non-binary, trans and agender people)"
1;"More transparency about the work of student self-administration is definitely necessary. In our opinion, these committees are currently doing their work largely isolated from the students."
1;"Autonomous units form a safer space for FINTA* people and other marginalized groups. These need to be expanded."
1;"More participation in the establishment of framework conditions is desirable in principle."
1;"Student councils do important work and, in our opinion, are more present on the campuses and in the O-weeks for first semester students. This work should be better supported financially."

-1;"Nope."
0;"We consider free menstrual products to be very important. However, we believe it's wrong to broadly state that all students should finance such a project."
-1;"In previous drafts of an awareness concept, police interventions at the university were rejected to protect potential perpetrators based on their background. An awareness concept in that form must not exist."
-1;"A deregistration is a deregistration – those who genuinely cannot attend should not receive sanctions."
-1;"If there are unlimited exam attempts, exams will, in the long term, simply be made more difficult to compensate for the lack of a limit. We also want to advocate for a University of Duisburg-Essen where it is worthwhile to study. With an infinite number of exam attempts, unfortunately, the value of the degree also decreases, and with it, the chances of entering professional life."
1;"The Deutschlandticket offers many advantages and is fairly priced."
0;"We urgently need more common areas – generally. Whether they are in green spaces or in university buildings should not play a major role."
1;"For flexible studies, students should always have the opportunity to go to the library. Even at 3 AM. The cafeterias are also important spots for campus life and should remain open longer."
1;"We are fully committed to academic freedom (freedom of research), which also includes research for military purposes."

-1;"The economic situation is already weighing heavily on students. We want budget discipline instead of an increasing semester fee."
1;"The semester fee has increased by 15,7 % this semester. At the same time BaföG rates have only been raised by 5%, while inflation has increased by 2,1%. This increase is disproportional and should be stopped!"
-1;"The student parliament’s only role is representing the interests of the students, just as it’s says in the Hochschulgesetz. The RCDS opposes any change to this."
-1;"The RCDS Duisburg-Essen wants every student to have the freedom to decide for themself whether and how to use gender-inclusive language."
1;"Menstrual products are essential hygiene for women and offering them in women’s restrooms is good policy. This should primarily be a task for the university, however."
1;"A Code of Conduct for events financed by the student body are a good idea to allow the punishment of bad actors and enable all students to attend events worry-free. However, this Code of Conduct has to be based on the relevant expertise, not ideology."
1;"During the student parliament’s last term of office the average session only saw a little more than half the member’s attending. To combat this disgraceful status quo, sanctions for repeated failure to attend are appropriate, even if the member cancels. This should not apply if there are valid reasons or a substitute is sent instead."
-1;"Exams should be taken seriously. To enable a thoughtful approach to studying there should be an adequate upper limit to the number of permissible exam attempts."
1;"The benefits of the semester ticket should be expanded and the price cut, not the other way around! We also support the reintroduction of free bike transport."
1;"Green spaces significantly improve the feel and look of the university campus, thereby making it a nice place to study. "
1;"Longer opening hours for cafeterias and libraries are useful to the students."
1;"The RCDS stands for our military, especially in the light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other political developments. Also, “military” research mostly benefits civil society as well."
-1;"Quotas and forced gender parity are incompatible with meritocracy. The RCDS values qualifications over identity politics."
-1;"A lively discourse culture is important for the student parliament. That only works when there is no pressure to finish."
1;"Students should be made aware of the existing services, especially when their money is being spent on them. Transparency has often been lacking in the past, so it should be intensified in the future."
-1;"There are already six autonomous committees which receive more than 3500€ per month. Given these costs the supervision of the autonomous committees should be improved and the number of autonomous committees should be decreased through sensible mergers."
-1;"The student parliament is responsible for how the students’ money is used. Therefore it should be able to establish a common regulatory framework for the autonomous committees to ensure transparency and efficacy."

-1;"The student body fee has been increased by only 27 cents within the last five years. Since the AStA is also affected by inflation, there should be a small adjustment so that we do not have to cancel services. The increase should be as low as possible and within a tolerable range."
1;"Major factors that lead to an increase in the semester fee are the DeutschlandTicket and the Studierendenwerk. The latter must definitely receive more funding from the state so that not all increases fall exclusively on the students."
1;"The interests of our students must also be represented politically. Political education should be promoted and diverse opinions should be made visible."
-1;"A compulsion to use gender-neutral language could strengthen the rejection of it. In addition, there is currently no uniform form of gendering. For this reason, we reject a duty and rely on voluntariness. No one should be disadvantaged because of the use of gender-neutral language."
0;"AStA and StuPa should set a good example and equip a few important toilets with free menstrual products. However, the financial outlay to equip each individual toilet would be too high. It is more important to get the university to offer them. After all, the university routinely pays for toilet paper and soap anyway, which will be joined by menstrual products in the future. If we were to equip all toilets regularly with the money from the student body, the university would have little reason to participate."
1;"There should be an awareness guideline. This should create concise framework conditions for good awareness work. A document that is too long makes the work of volunteers more difficult, and too many rules often mean that it is not possible to respond to flexible needs."
0;"It is not possible to sanction elected parliamentarians. After all, the StuPa presidium should not be able to throw out individual parliamentarians, as this could also be exploited for undemocratic purposes. However, attendance rates should remain publicly available so that voters can find out for themselves how often elected parliamentarians actually appear. This can also be a motivator for increased attendance."
0;"Exam anxiety is a real problem. However, the abolition of limited examination attempts could reduce the quality of a UDE degree. In order to reduce exam anxiety, exam registration and exam deregistration should become more flexible for the time being. But one could also increase the number of permissible failed attempts in favor of our students."
1;"The DeutschlandTicket is a wonderful achievement of the student body and the federal government. It should also be preserved and promoted in the future. We reject price increases."
1;"Our mission is to improve campus life. Our students will only spend more time on campus if it is a nice place to stay."
1;"First and foremost, we now have to fight to ensure that the opening hours do not decrease. This could happen due to the current financial situation of the university."
1;"The security situation in the world has changed. The Bundeswehr budget in the federal budget has been increased. We have to react to these developments in order to adapt to the current situation. It is better if this research is done in public rather than exclusively privately organized."
1;"Voluntary quotas often lead to women being on the lists, but usually ending up in the back, less promising places. The zipper principle (alternating staffing) is more effective in actually getting more women into parliament."
-1;"The student parliament is a democratic body in which democratic discussions must take place. We cannot limit the time of the meetings out of convenience."
1;"Doing public relations work for the AStA is not part of the student parliament's area of responsibility. However, the student parliament itself should do public relations work by maintaining a website and informing students about the parliament."
-1;"We have already achieved a good number of autonomous departments that cover the needs of most students. A new department would inevitably result in an increase in the student body fee."
-1;"The formal framework conditions should be determined by the student parliament so that they are uniform and elaborated. This allows the autonomous departments to concentrate on their substantive work. The substantive work must continue to be carried out independently of the student parliament."
1;"Student councils organize events that are better adapted to the needs of the respective degree programs. This strengthens the cohesion among the students within the student council. For this reason, we would like to strengthen the student councils in order to arouse the interest of more students in campus life."

-1;"The student body contribution, which goes to the student representatives, amounts to only 16 euros, which is a small portion of the total semester contribution, but ensures, among other things, that social support services can be provided and that the interests of students are represented. We are against an increase in the contribution. However, this should not lead to cuts in social services for students."
1;"The semester contribution as a whole should not be increased. Significant increases are due to the enormous underfunding of student services by the state and price increases for the semester ticket. We must work together with other student representatives at the state and federal level to combat these problems."
-1;"Political education is one of our core concerns. Political positions are also provided for in the Higher Education Act insofar as they affect students or the freedom of research and teaching."
1;"Even though we as a university group pay attention to gender-neutral language ourselves, we do not believe that a regulation would be helpful or convince more people of the issue."
1;"Menstrual products are hygiene items like soap, toilet paper, and towels, which must be provided by the university. If the university refuses to provide these products, we will advocate for the university to fulfill this obligation. In individual cases, the student council can provide menstrual products as a temporary measure until a comprehensive offering is available."
1;"An awareness concept (e.g., a retreat for neurodiverse people) is an important tool to ensure that everyone feels comfortable at events. However, it must be practical and not too complicated. In addition, the student councils should be involved in the design process, as they organize most of the parties."
-1;"Parliamentarians cannot be sanctioned for their absence from parliamentary sessions, as the only real sanction, the withdrawal of voting rights, would be deeply undemocratic. In the case of people who are frequently absent with excuse, it can be assumed that they are unable or unwilling to do the work. We therefore believe that the lists have a responsibility to talk to their parliamentarians in such cases and, if in doubt, to recommend that they resign."
1;"We are committed to ensuring that studying is seen as an opportunity and not as a stressful situation. Bielefeld University, for example, already offers this model. In view of the increasing number of students with mental health problems, we are committed to abolishing the limit on exam attempts."
1;"In terms of price, the semester ticket is now back where the NRW semester ticket was last. The price will remain stable for the coming year. We sorely miss the option of taking bicycles and passengers with us at certain times and will campaign to have this offer extended to the semester ticket."
1;"We fully agree with the demand for more green spaces on both campuses. Unfortunately, too little is currently being done to protect biodiversity, which is particularly worthy of protection at this time. We need more green spaces for people, animals, and plants. We are therefore committed to ensuring that existing green spaces are preserved and, ideally, expanded."
1;"Different realities of life require different learning times. In order to better accommodate these different realities, we demand longer opening hours for libraries and cafeterias. We are committed to ensuring that all students have good learning opportunities during their study hours."
-1;"Public universities are civil institutions whose core mission is to build a peaceful social structure through research and teaching and to promote responsible use of our ecological resources. We acknowledge the realities of realpolitik and the relevance of research that addresses complex global challenges. However, we see it as our duty to advocate for the prioritization and promotion of research areas that directly serve civil progress."
-1;"We believe that mandatory parity on Stupa lists is not effective. Our goal is to empower all people, but especially multiply marginalized groups that are often underrepresented in political representation. The ability to fill lists flexibly allows for the continued existence of lists with a higher proportion of women or other underrepresented groups. This promotes the visibility and entry into parliament of people who might otherwise be disadvantaged."
-1;"We reject a rigid time limit for Stupa meetings. Intensive exchange and lively discussions in parliament are crucial for our work and enable us to comprehensively represent the interests of the student body. Ending meetings early would inevitably mean that we would be able to discuss significantly fewer topics and make well-informed decisions. We believe that other measures, such as preliminary discussions between the lists, are better suited to prevent discussions at meetings from dragging on unnecessarily."
1;"Although public relations is the main task of the AStA, the Stupa can and should support this work and actively contribute to making its own work and decisions visible to the student body. In this way, we ensure that all important information reaches the students and that the Stupa can optimally fulfill its role as a representative body."
0;"If there is a proposal for this that we can understand, we would not oppose it. However, we believe that our existing autonomous departments and the newly established department for students with a migration background already cover a lot of ground. The existing departments should be strengthened."
1;"Budgetary aspects must be decided by the Stupa, i.e., the budget and expense allowances. However, the departments concerned should be involved and consulted as much as possible. Everything else is up to the departments themselves."
0;"The student councils are an essential part of student representation and campus life. Projects that exceed the available budget can be financed through the application funds in the AStA, the Stupa, and the student council conference. However, if there is a significant overall increase in financial requirements, this must be taken seriously. However, this must not be at the expense of other student institutions."
