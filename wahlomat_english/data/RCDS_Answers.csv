1;"We want to strengthen campus life and the student councils make a significant contribution to this. Hybrid teaching should be strengthened, but only as a supplementary offer. The focus should continue to be on classroom teaching so that the social component of studying is not neglected."

1;"Students' money should be handled carefully. We advocate a reform of the Akduell. Currently, Akduell does not correspond to the form of a university magazine."
0;"We advocate more flexible deadlines. We do not consider the general abolition of deadlines to be sensible or possible."
1;"The main work of the AStA should be to represent the interests of the students. There is no room for ideological politics."
1;"International networking with other Western democracies, including at an academic level, is a valuable asset. The UDE should stand by its partnership with Israel and its universities, especially in light of the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7."
-1;"Gender asterisks and gender gaps are unaesthetic, confusing and disrupt the flow of reading. They should be avoided in official university documents."
-1;"The RCDS considers an obligation to use gender-appropriate language in academic papers to be an unjustified restriction of students' rights. Every student should decide for themselves whether and how to use gender."
1;"Without compensation for inflation, the BAföG rate would in fact fall from year to year. We stand by the financial support of students."
1;"In general, food in the canteen and cafeteria should be subsidized. As students, we pay €110 in semester fees to the Studierendenwerk, so the food on offer in the cafeteria and canteen should be cheaper than comparable offers outside."
1;"Anyone can find themselves in a situation where they need financial help. The social loan offers a quick and uncomplicated solution to help affected students."
1;"We regret the discontinuation of passenger and bicycle transport due to the incompletely designed Deutschlandticket. However, we would like to retain the option of using just one ticket throughout Germany. However, we also advocate the reintroduction of passenger and bicycle transport at least in the VRR area."
1;"The student unions have long had a problem with funding. In order to ensure their work without burdening the students, more financial support from the state is necessary."
1;"The semester fee must not be allowed to rise any further. We also advocate cost savings and a smaller AStA in order to be able to reduce the semester fee."
1;"Individual mobility is very important to us. For many, the Deutschlandticket is a downgrade due to the elimination of passenger and bicycle transport. That is why we are in favor of a voluntary discounted semester ticket that does not necessarily have to be purchased. Not everyone needs a ticket or has the opportunity to use it sensibly in everyday life and is dependent on a car."
1;"We support the abolition of examination attempts, but consider it sensible to regulate examination attempts in a modified form."
1;"Menstrual products are an essential part of personal hygiene. Providing them free of charge would be an important support service for female students."
1;"We advocate more outdoor recreational areas. We consider it sensible to examine suitable areas for additional sustainable greening."
0;"As the RCDS, we support an extension of opening hours, especially the opening of cafés at weekends. However, there should always be a cost-benefit analysis for such an extension."
