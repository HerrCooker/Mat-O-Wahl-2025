1;"Food should not be a question of your own wallet. We want to introduce free tables together with the Studierendenwerk, which students in need can use to get free meals in the canteen. No one should have to go on campus being hungry."
1;"In Germany, the country of digitalization, it can happen that there is no internet on the train. Students suffer under the current regulation, because they have to pay a fine if they cannot show their ticket. That is why we are calling for the ticket to be available offline and valid being printed out, as it used to be."
0;"The student councils receive almost €200,000 per financial year from the semester fees. We are in favor of financially strong and independent student councils, but a further increase of allocation to the student councils would mean that the semester fee would have to be increased."
-1;"From our perspective, this is not a task for the university, and certainly not a task for the student body. Our university maintains relationships with universities all over the world, which is part part of academic freedom and that's a good thing."
1;"In times of war and crises, it can certainly happen that money runs out at the end of the month and the semester fees are due, or the washing machine breaks down. For such cases, we want to establish a social loan for all students, where they can take out an interest-free interest-free loan from the AStA for one year, which they can use to to bridge the emergency. At the end of the period, this must be repaid, but without interest. The KFW Bank charges interest on similar loans of up to 30%, which would be an enormous imposition."
1;"Exam nerves, difficult living conditions, strokes of fate - Unfortunately, this is part of everyday life for some. Even in the past, we have actively campaigned for better conditions and the abolition of a limited number of exams. In this respect, we are following the model of the University of Bielefeld."
1;"Students with care work, parents and students who have to earn a living alongside their full-time studies would< benefit from this."
0;"The university already uses them. It should not be obligatory."
1;"Mobility does not stop at the borders of our municipality, so the semester ticket should continue to be valid throughout Germany."
1;"Menstruation should not be a financial disadvantage in life. That's why we are campaigning for free menstrual products in all toilets at the university."
1;"Currently, every student pays €0.75 of the semester fee for the student newspaper, which is unfortunately unknown to many. With around €30,000 per semester, the newspaper is well funded. We appreciate the work of the editorial team, but measures need to be taken to improve public relations."
0;"Students should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to use gender-neutral language in their work. However the use of GGS must not influence the assessment of a thesis."
1;"For decades, the state government has not increased the subsidy for the Studierendenwerke, despite rising student numbers and inflation. Student unions do indispensable work, such as the provision of student dorms, or the operation of canteens and cafeterias. For a more socially equitable study program student services organizations must finally be paid better by the CDU-led state government."
1;"The university needs to find a good balance between sealed areas and green spaces. We would like to see a lively campus with sufficient recreational areas and more greenery instead of asphalt."
1;"Compared to other universities, the UDE lags behind in reducing bureaucracy and flexibility. Short-term deregistrations reduce bureaucracy and thus relieve the burden on the examinations system. We support this demand."
1;"Currently, the maximum BAföG rate is below the poverty line in Germany. Students should be able to study without financial worries, which is why the BAföG should be, just like other state transfer payments, adjusted to the be adjusted to the general price trend."
1;"The student body already receives enough money with xxxx€, to promote and support many cool, stable projects. So before the semester fee is increased any further, the AStA should first review or reduce previous expenditure."
1;"The campus should be a place where students can also spend time outside of their lectures. That's why we believe that cafeterias and the library should be open longer. For many students with small apartments (maybe even having to share their space with their siblings), the library is the only place where they can study in peace."
1;"According to the Higher Education Act, the AStA has a general political mandate. The AStA should certainly concentrate on university-related issues, but should not ignore other political issues, as these topics are often very closely interwoven. For example, if we are committed to a more socially just higher education, we cannot avoid addressing the financial politics of the state government."

1;"Food and water are basic rights and should also be affordable for financially disadvantaged students."
1;"We know that taking people and bicycles on the old semester ticket was very important for many students, so we will work to ensure that this option is available again. We are also campaigning for the ticket to be available offline again in order to avoid increased transportation fees."
0;"Inflation is everywhere and a slight adjustment to the student body fee would also benefit the student councils."
0;"The university has already commented on this in the past."
1;"We have campaigned for this in the student parliament in recent years and will continue to support this in the future."
1;"Exams are anxiety and stressful situations for most students. Students should be given psychological relief."
1;"Videos improve the compatibility of studying with other duties such as care work."
1;"As an educational institution, the university should act as a role model here and try to include all genders in its language. There should be a standardized procedure for this."
1;"The achievement of a student ticket that is valid throughout Germany is a great success. We are committed to ensuring that this is maintained."
1;"Menstrual products are expensive and menstruation cannot always be planned, which is why the products should be made available to students."
0;"An evaluation of the Akduell funds makes sense if it aims to strengthen Akduell."
-1;"Students must not be disadvantaged if they decide against gender-inclusive language. Students should be empowered to deal with this topic in a differentiated way and to decide on a language variant based on their own reflection, instead of introducing an authoritarian obligation which, in case of doubt, has a rather negative effect."
1;"The student parliament should campaign for this publicly, as the financial situation in the student unions is under increasing pressure."
1;"With the construction of the new parking garages, more parking spaces have been created. Therefore, parking spaces directly on campus should be unsealed to create space and recreational opportunities for students and ensure more biodiversity."
0;"We consider it sensible to cancel up to 24 hours before the examination date. Registration up to 24 hours poses major logistical challenges for the university in terms of room planning etc."
1;"Students must not be financially disadvantaged by inflation."
0;"The contribution for the student body should increase, when it is necessary in order to have an effective political student representation, that can also make social offers to students in need. An increase at some point in the future would amount to one or two euros."
1;"The opening hours should reflect the flexible organization of studies, and the university should also be usable as a meeting place outside of lectures and seminars."
-1;"According to the Higher Education Act, the AStA is responsible for political education and the promotion of active tolerance and is therefore not only required to deal with strictly university-related topics."

0; “There is no question that everyone should be able to afford something to eat. However, we believe that a more flexible subsidy is more beneficial to students in financial need. This proposal would of course benefit these people, but we think it is overly specific.”
1; “The free bicycle transport was an offer of the old semester ticket, which many students took advantage of. It is therefore a great loss that this benefit is no longer available with the Deutschlandticket. This is because many commuters study at our university who travel to the campuses from neighboring cities. The bicycle is an efficient and climate-friendly solution to avoid being dependent on the unreliable public transportation of individual cities. For this reason, we are fighting for the reintroduction of free bicycle transportation. Equally important for us is the provision of an offline ticket so that students are not chained to a digital device. It's annoying when your battery runs out after partying and the ticket inspector can't see your ticket.”
1; “Student councils organize events that are better adapted to the needs of the respective course of study. This strengthens cohesion among students. For this reason, we would like to strengthen the student councils in order to get more students interested in campus life. This requires changes to the statues to strengthen the financial resources allocated to the student councils.”
-1; “The university has already acknowledged the situation to a sufficient extent.”
1; “According to the Federal Statistical Office, 37.9% of students in Germany were at risk of poverty in 2021. For too many students, the risk of financial hardship is real. The social loan is particularly worthy of support as an accessible aid in these situations.”
-1; “Our degrees must not lose quality. Proposals such as the abolition of examination attempts or the inflationary use of free attempts jeopardize the recognition of our degrees.”
1; “Cameras are already installed in most lecture halls, which is why the necessary infrastructure is already in place. Unfortunately, many lecturers do not use them. For this reason, we would like to encourage them to offer lecture videos in order to strengthen hybrid teaching. This is because it is not always possible to attend lectures on site due to illness or for personal reasons. Lecture videos are also helpful for independent learning, according to your own schedule, or for repeating certain sections.”
1; “In official university documents, gender-inclusive language is already the de facto norm. It therefore makes sense to formalize the de facto procedure.”
1; “Validity throughout germany is good and to be supported. However, if this results in significant additional costs, a more cost-efficient ticket model should be chosen.”
1; “We know from the student council conference that any offers are generally well received by the student body.”
1; “We advocate a reform of the student newspaper Akduell. It currently does not do justice to the amount of funding it receives. The newspaper statute stipulates that the Akduell must also appear in print. However, the Akduell is no longer printed. The amount of its funding is no longer legitimate due to the discontinuation of this core task. In addition, many students do not read the Akduell in its current form.”
0; “The usefulness of gender-appropriate language varies from subject to subject. A blanket compulsion works against the social acceptance of gender. We would therefore like to leave it up to the students themselves to decide whether to use gender-inclusive language in their assignments.”
1; “Despite rising costs, the state has not adjusted the amount of its contribution for a long time. Especially in view of the declining number of enrolments, the financing of the Studierendenwerk is on shaky ground. As we are in favor of open studies that can be mastered regardless of your wallet, we are in favor of a strong Studierendenwerk. For this reason, the state should offer further financial support, as not to burden our students with higher semester fees or higher canteen prices.”
1; “More places to sit and relax in green spaces promote campus life. Especially on warm days, when the indoor spaces are plagued by poor air quality, it is a good idea to work outside.
1; “Other universities are already demonstrating that registration and deregistration can work much more flexibly. The current procedure encourages excessive registration, as this decision is required so early in the semester. The abolition of the deregistration deadline would considerably relieve the examination office, as in most cases of illness a simple deregistration would make obtaining a certificate unnecessary. This would also allow students to decide for themselves whether they are fit to take an exam on the day of the examination.”
1; “The BAföG rate should cover the basic needs of students. Even now, many BAföG recipients have to see how they can make ends meet. Especially due to the high price increases in recent years. In our opinion, social participation and a carefree student life are also basic needs, which is why the BAföG contribution should at least be adjusted in line with inflation, so that our students don't have less money in their pockets than before.”
0; “The contribution to the Studierendenwerk must not increase any further. The student body fee is currently €16 and has only been increased slightly in the past. This should only be raised under the condition that the student body can no longer finance its tasks and goals well.”
0; “The opening hours are already good. Longer opening hours must not put students at a disadvantage. We fear that the Studierendenwerk could use longer opening hours to try and justify a higher financial contribution, which would be a burden on students. Without disadvantages, however, they are to be welcomed.”
1; “In our opinion, the AStA should concentrate on the needs of the students. General political issues should be less of a focus.”

1;"In general, food in the canteen and cafeteria should be subsidized. As students, we pay €110 in semester fees to the Studierendenwerk, so the food on offer in the cafeteria and canteen should be cheaper than comparable offers outside."
1;"Individual mobility is very important to us. For many, the Deutschlandticket is a downgrade due to the elimination of passenger and bicycle transport. That is why we are in favor of a voluntary discounted semester ticket that does not necessarily have to be purchased. Not everyone needs a ticket or has the opportunity to use it sensibly in everyday life and is dependent on a car."
1;"We want to strengthen campus life and the student councils make a significant contribution to this."
1;"International networking with other Western democracies, including at an academic level, is a valuable asset. The UDE should stand by its partnership with Israel and its universities, especially in light of the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th."
1;"Anyone can find themselves in a situation where they need financial help. The social loan offers a quick and uncomplicated solution to help affected students."
1;"We support the abolition of examination attempts, but consider it sensible to regulate examination attempts in a modified form."
0;"Hybrid teaching should be strengthened, but only as a supplementary offer. The focus should continue to be on classroom teaching, so that the social component of the course is not neglected."
-1;"Gender asterisks and gender gaps are unaesthetic, confusing and disrupt the flow of reading. They should be avoided in official university documents."
1;"We regret the discontinuation of passenger and bicycle transport due to the incompletely designed Deutschlandticket. However, we would like to retain the option of using just one ticket throughout Germany, while we also advocate the reintroduction of passenger and bicycle transport, at least in the VRR area."
1;"Menstrual products are an essential part of personal hygiene. Providing them free of charge would be an important support service for female students."
1;"Students' money should be handled carefully. We advocate a reform of the Akduell. Currently the Akduell does not correspond to the form of a university magazine."
-1;"The RCDS considers an obligation to use gender-appropriate language in academic papers to be an unjustified restriction of students' rights. Every student should decide for themselves whether and how to use gender."
1;"The student unions have had a problem with funding for a long time. In order to ensure their work without burdening the students, more financial support from the state is necessary."
1;"We advocate more outdoor recreational areas. We consider it sensible to examine suitable areas for additional sustainable greening."
0;"We advocate more flexible deadlines. We do not consider the general abolition of deadlines to be sensible or possible."
1;"Without compensation for inflation, the BAföG rate would in fact fall from year to year. We stand by the financial support of students."
1;"The semester fee must not be allowed to rise any further. We also advocate cost savings and a smaller AStA in order to be able to reduce the semester fee."
0;"As the RCDS, we support an extension of opening hours, especially the opening of cafés on weekends. However, there should always be a cost-benefit analysis for such an extension."
1;"The main work of the AStA should be to represent the interests of the students. There is no room for ideological politics."
